Issue gives 2 in 1: req and solution.<br>Can we separate the list with requirements from instatiation of reqs?<br>A: The portal is meant to improve the lifecycle and create a single pane of glass for documentation, API specifications etc.<br>Q: Is the portal for info sharing or onboarding devs and invoke APIs?<br>A: Not for invocation of API, it is a catalogue of APIs and doc, user profiles can be created for Camara contributors |
