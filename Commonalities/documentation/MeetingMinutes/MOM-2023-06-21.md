| Agenda Item | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|API readiness checklist (Issue [#139](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/139))|Fabrizio presented the concern about 6th criterion of API readiness: "Tested by at least 2 operators" and discussed the proposal to change it to "Tested by one operator, recommended by another Operator or Camara partner". Since DT and Telefonica are not willing to change the current criteria the question should be resolved on higher level under new governance model. Randy suggested that APIs can be offered to developers prior reaching version 1.0 as "Beta" release indicating possible braking changes. The discussion also covered other criteria (tests) and concluded that the new issue will be opened by Fabrizio to collect views before escalating question| |
|Issue [#170](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/170) | version number on API Design Guidelines - solution under preparation is to extend Commonalities WG with its own repository, where it will deliver common artifacts (including documents) and have regular releases like other subprojects|
| Issue [#196](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/196) | Require used (SI) units - Device Location applied basic SI units for used parameters. Decisions stay on subproject level.|
