## Discussion

| **Agenda  Item**  |  Owner| Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **Recent updates & recap** | | - API backlog call on 5th October was cancelled - none available for moderating the call. <br> -  Results from TSC meeting held on 5th Oct available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/TSC/TSC-2023-10-05-Meeting-Minutes.md). <br>- Huawei became supporter of Device Swap API and IMEI Fraud API. <br> - Network Insight API [#294](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/294) taken for approval at TSC meeting on 19 Oct. <br> - Service Booking API [#317](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/317) is a new API proposal in the backlog.   | 
| **Current issues** |  |  |
| [#271](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/271)  | China Telecom, Huawei| **New API proposal: Site to cloud (S2C) VPN**</br> Updates: </br> - Planned for discussion/approval on TSC meeting on 5th Oct, but eventually not treated. <br> - Still under discussion in the TSC, from comments coming from TMForum and AT&T. <br> China Telecom/Huawei asks for clearer feedback from TSC for knowing how to move on (AP 20231019-01). <br> Huawei proposes a way forward, to start creating a technology agnostic service API that can be adapted in the future to the TMF more specific approach. <br> - Issue not eligible to be closed. |
| [#284](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/284) | MTN | **New API proposal: Device Swap**</br> Updates: </br> - API taken for approval at TSC meeting on 5th October (AP 20230907-01 closed)   </br>  - TSC outcome: API approved, to be allocated into a new Sub-Project (name TBD). </br> - Supporting companies need to nominate maintainers, so the new Sub-Project can be set up (AP 20231019-02). <br> - Issue not eligible to be closed.  |
| [#285](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/285) | MTN | **New API proposal: IMEI Fraud**</br> </br> Updates: </br> - API taken for approval at TSC meeting on 5th October (AP 20230907-02 closed)   </br>  - TSC outcome: API approved, to be allocated into the existing [DeviceIdentifier](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceIdentifier) Sub-Project. </br> - Issue eligible to be closed.  |
| [#294](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/294) | Verizon| **New API proposal: Network Insights** <br> Updates: <br> - Verizon has filled out missing information on technical details in the API proposal (AP 20230907-05 closed).<br> - The API voting has been included in the agenda of TSC meeting on 19th October (AP 20230907-05 closed). </br> - TSC outcome: API approved, to be allocated into a new Sub-Project (name TBD).  TSC has asked the WG to find a more specific and understandable API name for Network Insights (AP 20231019-03), in line with Ericsson's comments in the issue thread. </br> There was some discussion about naming during the call. The proposal from Verizon is to maintain a generic naming that can embrace several use cases, like current Device Status API. </br> - Supporting companies need to nominate maintainers, so the new Sub-Project can be set up (AP 20231019-04).</br> - Issue not eligible to be closed. |

# Q&A

**How does CAMARA API pipeline work?**

The pipeline consists of FOUR stages:
<br> A. Submission of the API proposal.
<br> B. Evaluation of the API proposal.
<br> C. API proposal voting & decision.
<br> D. Sub-Project setup.

The following clauses provides details on individual stages. 

**Stage A: Submission of the API proposal**

<u>Participants</u>: API owner.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). To proceed with the submission, the API owner shall follow these steps:
1. Fill in the template available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/API-proposal-template.md) and save it with the following name: "APIproposal\_\<APIname\>\_\<owner\>. md" locally.
2. Create a new issue in the API Backlog Working Group repository, labeled with "API Backlog".
3. Upload the filled-in template to [GitHub repository folder for API proposals](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/tree/main/APIBacklog/documentation/SupportingDocuments/API%20proposals) via Pull Request. This Pull Request shall be associated to the issue created in the previous step.

**Stage B: Evaluation of the API proposal** 

<u>Participants</u>: API owner, API backlog WG.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon submission, the API owner will present the proposal in the next API backlog WG meeting, to socialize it with the rest of partners. In paralell..

1. The WG chair checks that the template is duly filled in. Otherwise, the API owner is requested to provide missing information.
2. After this sanity check, each WG participant declares their support. If a company wants to become supporter of an API, then a delegate of this company needs to add the company's name in the 'supporters' column in the [API backlog table](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md). The more support an API proposal gets, the better (it may get more traction).
3. When the API owner considers the API proposal is in good shape to go for approval, it informs the WG chair accordingly.
4. Upon receiving this information, the WG chair merges the Pull Request into the main branch, and sends the API proposal to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) of CAMARA. This action shall be completed at least one week prior to the TSC meeting where the API proposal will be voted upon.
 
The whole procedure (steps 1-4) should be done within 2 regular meetings of the API Backlog WG. Nonetheless, it is up to the API owner to decide if it wants to shorten or extend this time period.

**Stage C: API proposal & voting decision**

<u>Participants</u>: TSC.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon receiving the API proposal and notification from the API backlog WG chair, the TSC studies the proosal and votes it at the next TSC meeting. 

NOTE 1: Possible decisions outcomes:
- Not Accepted: The API proposal is rejected, and thus will not be included in any API Sub-Project. The TSC will need to inform the API backlog WG of this decision, and clarify next steps: either (1) remove this API proposal from backlog, with objecting companies providing justifications why; or (2) ask for changes (e.g., clarifications, corrections, gaps to be addressed) required in order for the API to be re-submitted by the API supporters.
- Accepted: In this case, the TSC shall specify whether the API proposal is to be hosted by a new or existing Sub Project.

NOTE 2: The TSC may also propose changes to an API proposal and take the decision considering these changes. The TSC documents the decision in the [CAMARA API overview list](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md) (fills in columns TSC date and TSC decision / Sub Project; in case of a No-Go "Rejected" is documented there).

**Stage D: Sub-Project setup**

<u>Participants</u>: API backlog WG, TSC, CAMARA admin team<br>
<u>Description</u>: If an API proposal is accepted and there is a neeed to open a new Sub-Project, the following steps are needed:
1. Supporting companies propose their initial maintainers to be added for the Sub-Project. The API backlog WG chair centralizes this information, and sends it to the TSC.
2. The TSC will use this input to oficially nominate the initial maintainers by next TSC meeting.
3. The CAMARA admin team creates the Sub-Project repository. 

NOTE: After the initial maintainers are nominated, the criteria for further maintainers would be three months of active contribution to the sub project. Code owners are to be decided by the maintainers within the subproject.
