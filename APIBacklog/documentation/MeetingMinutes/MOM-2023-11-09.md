## New Procedures in API backlog meetings

A number of improvements are under discussion with leadership team of OGW project (Henry), CAMARA Project (Markus), Product Definition WS (Helene) and TSC (Herbert). For the time being, the agreement vailable for WG adoption are these ones:
1. To close the agenda SEVEN DAYS BEFORE the conf. call. 
	- In case a WG participant wants to include a point in the agenda (e.g., present a new API proposal), this participant shall ensure the corresponding issue is opened in Github by then. 
	- Exceptional situations will be treated separately.
2. To shift API backlog WG conf. calls 1 week, ensuring TSC and API backlog meetings are scheduled in alternate weeks. This action will enable more TSC delegates to join the API backlog WG. The Proposal is to schedule biweekly calls:
	- 2nd Thursday of the month (10-11 CET)
	- 4th Thursday of the month (16-17 CET)

A mail was sent via mail list on 2nd Nov informing that:
- Point 1 was endorsed and WG adopted
- Point 2 would go for 7-day mail approval (AP 20231102-01). Comments:
	- KDDI contacted off-line asking to-reschedule the 4th Thursday call  to 15-16 CET. The reason is that the proposed time (16-17 CET) is quite late for Japanese delegates (00-01 JPT), and there are already other calls (AHC and TSC) scheduled on that slot. 
	- Huawei asked for more time to check internally. After internal checks, they are ok.

**Decision:** AP 20231102-01 can be closed, with the following agreement regarding the call series:
	- 2nd Thursday of the month (10-11 CET)
	- 4th Thursday of the month (15-16 CET)



## Discussion

| **Agenda  Item**  |  Owner| Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **Recent updates & recap** | | - Minutes of last API backlog WG call available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-11-02.md) <br> - PR [#331](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/331) still ongoing. This is the first step of all the actions identified in [#100](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/issues/100).<br> - Network Insights API proposal ended up becoming Connectivity Insights, , acknowledged by TSC, and [Sub-Project](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights) was created accordingly. Verizon was asked to bring more maintainers to the Sub-Project, so that PRs can be reviewed. Kevin Smith (Vodafone) volunteered to become maintainer. 
| **Current issues** |  |  |
| [#271](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/271)  | China Telecom, Huawei| **New API proposal: Site to cloud (S2C) VPN**</br> Updates: <br> - No progress of nominating initial maintainers (AP 20231102-02 still open).|

| [#328](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/328) | China Unicom | **New API proposal: Region User Count** <br>The API template is available in [PR#327](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/327). <br> Input from OGW drop #3. <br> Updates: <br> - [#328](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/328) and  [#334](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/334) will be treated in the same Sub-Project (up to TSC to decide which one (existing or new), though we can provide them some guidance/recommendation in this regard). <br> - CAMARA will need not only to agree upon the actual API definition (input/output params), but also on the API logic (the computation formula whereby output params can be generated/computed out of the input params). <br> - The API owner was asked to provide further details on **technical details** (AP 20231109-01). In particular, it is required to clarify i) that the number provided in the API output is per operator; ii) that only active users are counted (idle mode user does not compute). 
| [#330](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/330) | China Unicom| **New API proposal: Device Visit Location**<br>The API template is available in [PR#329](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/329). <br> Input from OGW drop #3. <br> Updates: <br>  - The API owner was asked to provide further details on **technical scope** (AP 20231109-02). In particular, it is required to clarify i) that time window (e.g. 7 days) is a configurable input param, and ii) that output parameter can change depending on local market (in China there are provinces, in UK there are counties, etc). <br> - The API owner was asked to provide further details on **API driver** (AP 20231109-03). In particular, it is required to clarify whether this API proposal is driven by business or regulation, and why. <br> The API owner was asked to provide further details on **operator obligations** (AP 20231109-04): for every user, operator needs to record this information continuously, and record/store this information for the selected time window (e.g. for 7 days), because the operator does not know if/when this information will be requested by API consumer. <br> - Orange and Vodafone thinks this API proposal, if/when approved, may  allocated into DeviceLocation. |

# Q&A

**How does CAMARA API pipeline work?**

The pipeline consists of FOUR stages:
<br> A. Submission of the API proposal.
<br> B. Evaluation of the API proposal.
<br> C. API proposal voting & decision.
<br> D. Sub-Project setup.

The following clauses provides details on individual stages. 

**Stage A: Submission of the API proposal**

<u>Participants</u>: API owner.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). To proceed with the submission, the API owner shall follow these steps:
1. Fill in the template available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/API-proposal-template.md) and save it with the following name: "APIproposal\_\<APIname\>\_\<owner\>. md" locally.
2. Create a new issue in the API Backlog Working Group repository, labeled with "API Backlog".
3. Upload the filled-in template to [GitHub repository folder for API proposals](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/tree/main/APIBacklog/documentation/SupportingDocuments/API%20proposals) via Pull Request. This Pull Request shall be associated to the issue created in the previous step.

**Stage B: Evaluation of the API proposal** 

<u>Participants</u>: API owner, API backlog WG.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon submission, the API owner will present the proposal in the next API backlog WG meeting, to socialize it with the rest of partners. In paralell..

1. The WG chair checks that the template is duly filled in. Otherwise, the API owner is requested to provide missing information.
2. After this sanity check, each WG participant declares their support. If a company wants to become supporter of an API, then a delegate of this company needs to add the company's name in the 'supporters' column in the [API backlog table](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md). The more support an API proposal gets, the better (it may get more traction).
3. When the API owner considers the API proposal is in good shape to go for approval, it informs the WG chair accordingly.
4. Upon receiving this information, the WG chair merges the Pull Request into the main branch, and sends the API proposal to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) of CAMARA. This action shall be completed at least one week prior to the TSC meeting where the API proposal will be voted upon.
 
The whole procedure (steps 1-4) should be done within 2 regular meetings of the API Backlog WG. Nonetheless, it is up to the API owner to decide if it wants to shorten or extend this time period.

**Stage C: API proposal & voting decision**

<u>Participants</u>: TSC.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon receiving the API proposal and notification from the API backlog WG chair, the TSC studies the proosal and votes it at the next TSC meeting. 

NOTE 1: Possible decisions outcomes:
- Not Accepted: The API proposal is rejected, and thus will not be included in any API Sub-Project. The TSC will need to inform the API backlog WG of this decision, and clarify next steps: either (1) remove this API proposal from backlog, with objecting companies providing justifications why; or (2) ask for changes (e.g., clarifications, corrections, gaps to be addressed) required in order for the API to be re-submitted by the API supporters.
- Accepted: In this case, the TSC shall specify whether the API proposal is to be hosted by a new or existing Sub Project.

NOTE 2: The TSC may also propose changes to an API proposal and take the decision considering these changes. The TSC documents the decision in the [CAMARA API overview list](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md) (fills in columns TSC date and TSC decision / Sub Project; in case of a No-Go "Rejected" is documented there).

**Stage D: Sub-Project setup**

<u>Participants</u>: API backlog WG, TSC, CAMARA admin team<br>
<u>Description</u>: If an API proposal is accepted and there is a neeed to open a new Sub-Project, the following steps are needed:
1. Supporting companies propose their initial maintainers to be added for the Sub-Project. The API backlog WG chair centralizes this information, and sends it to the TSC.
2. The TSC will use this input to oficially nominate the initial maintainers by next TSC meeting.
3. The CAMARA admin team creates the Sub-Project repository. 

NOTE: After the initial maintainers are nominated, the criteria for further maintainers would be three months of active contribution to the sub project. Code owners are to be decided by the maintainers within the subproject.
