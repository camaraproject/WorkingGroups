## Agenda

1. Discussion 
   - API onboarding and handling (session 1)
2. Action Points
3. AoB

## Discussion
The whole session has been focused on 20220707-05. TEF, with the valuable support and guidance from DT, has prepared a proposal scoping AP 20220707-05. This is of key importance for CAMARA and external process, specially in what relates to the pipeline from API proposal (how to make it available in the backlog?) to API development (allocating the API into a new or existing Sub-Project?)

The objective is to **discuss and agree on an open and transparent process for API onboarding and handling in CAMARA project**. 
- The discussions are conducted in the _API backlog WG_, since the critical points of this process are focused on ways of working in API backlog, and relationship with SteerCo. 
- The actions resulting from the discussion are issues are as follows:
  - issue [#53](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/53), tagged with Commonalities.
  - issue [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/57), tagged with Commonalities. 
  - issue [#59](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/59), tagged with Commonalities
  - issue [#12](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/12), already defined in API backlog. 

The PPT discussed during today's conf. call is available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/Contributions/20220727-CAMARA-API-onboarding-and-handling-process%20.pptx).

There slides discussed in today's conf. call are slides 1-8. The following comments have been captured. 
- Slide 2 -> need to better capture the API families block. 
- Slide 6 -> the tentative (new) workflow works when the API proposal is completely new, and proposes something that has not been discussed so far. However, there are situations where the API proposal (i) is clearly aligned with the scope of an on-going API subproject, or (ii) is in conflict with an API that is already being worked out in an on-going API subproject. These situations will not be uncommon, and shall be handled appropriately, possibly with other ways different from what is currently caputed in the tentative (new) workflow.
- Slides 7 and 8 -> no consensus whether Net Neutrality is in scope of CAMARA or not. Set aside (on hold) for the time being. 

With all the comments captured, Jose will generate a new version to be discussed next week -> **AP 20220728-01**
