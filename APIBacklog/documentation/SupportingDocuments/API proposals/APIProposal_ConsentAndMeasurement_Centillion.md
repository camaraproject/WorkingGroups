| API summary | The “Consent & Measurement” API suite is designed to provide the inputs necessary to power the world's digital ad ecosystem. From fueling insights for audience planning, measuring ad exposure, along post campaign validation and audience behavioral lift measurement. The Consent and Measurement APIs are designed to integrate with leading digital ad tech companies both on the Sell Side (SSPs, Publishers etc.) and the Buy Side (DSPs, Agency Trading Desks) and use the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) as the digital backbone of the ad-tech 'measurement' space. Leveraging the geospatial capabilities of the "CAMARA device location", natively integrated with a specific advertiser focused privacy/consent by design and ad-fraud free approach, these innovative inputs will streamline the $674B industry. The CAMARA capabilities are a natural enhancement to provide measurement lift in physical retail and along with digital out of home device exposure (Rideshares, billboards, Points of interest). Leveraging conversion signals from "CarrierBillingCheckOut" (Purchase/digital transaction/click to call) enables both physical and digital transaction impact measurement, tying mobile device to ad exposure to audience behavior to business objectives. CAMARA's commitment to interoperability and compliance with industry standards is a testament to its dedication to providing a transparent ad-tech measurement and advertiser consent verification framework.|
| Technical viability | The "Consent & Measurement" API family provides validated technical integrations with next generation ad tech infrastructure, mass adoption potential with emerging industry standards, such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab's. For MNOs and developers, this offers a path to long term viability and compliance across jurisdictions. By leveraging the scale of a standardized federated deployment, MNOs can reclaim revenue back from the tech industry that has created immense value on the back of the telecom infrastructure. By leveraging the structural advantages of the mobile network operators and provide a viable (if not superior alternative) to walled gardens (META / Google) "self-measurement" approach. CAMARA will uplift brands with greater transparency on ad measurement, the Consent and Measurement API will incentivize the adoption of the developer ecosystem with more ad revenue and innovation.|
| Commercial viability | The "Consent & Measurement" API has been proposed to leading conglomerate consumer brands, tech platforms, sell side publishers, buy side ad exchanges, and advertising trade organizations to gauge viability and industry adoption. When considering the commercial viability of the "Consent & Measurement" API, interested industry leaders gave it a unanimous “Yes.” The interested parties include LinkedIn, Univision, Proctor and Gamble, and TradeDesk. |
