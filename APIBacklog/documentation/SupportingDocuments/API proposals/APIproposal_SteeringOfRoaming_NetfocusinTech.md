| API family name | Steering of Roaming Information |
| API family owner | Netfocusin Technologies |
| API summary | **High level description**<br>The API can be used to control the distribution of outbound roaming traffic to different visited networks (VPLMN) from the home network (HPLMN) according to a certain steering policy.Typically, this can be used by mobile operators themselves to manage steering of roaming operations from a remote location through internet. The same can be used by their reselling partners who lack sufficient expertise in directly working with steering of roaming system.   <br><br>Some typical examples where mobile operators find it useful are:<li>to drive outbound roamers to a specific visited network to meet certain provisions in Inter Operator Tariff (IOT) discount aggrements set according to GSMA RAEX/AA.14 between HPLMN and different VPLMNs at a certain roaming location.</li><li>to drive outbound roamers away from the VPLMN across locations with who HPLMN is getting into a roaming dispute.</li><br>Some typical examples where Telco reseller or MVNO will benefit are:<li>to drive their outbound roaming subscribers to a specific visited network to meet certain quality of service issues reported from a specific VPLMN.</li><li>to drive their outbound roaming subscribers to a visited network to enjoy some premium services sponsored by the reseller or MVNO (e.g., MVNO has tied up with a licensed content provider who, in turn, has content sharing and distribution agreement with VPLMN A in country X. MVNO will try to make all its outbound roaming subscribers to country X to latch on to VPLMN A's network as long as it is within coverage) .</li><br>**Input params**<br><li>IMSI of the HPLMN operator or MVNO</li><li>PLMN id of the visited network at a particular destination. <br><br>**Output params**<br>No output is provided beyond the success/error response confirming whether necessary steering action has been successfully applied or not. <br><br>**Notifications** <br>No notifications are required for this API <br><br> |
| Technical viability | This API requires the availability of NEF with this Rel-15 "X"feature. | 
| Commercial viability | There is no a commercial or industrialized open source solution available with the capability mentioned. Most of the commercial steering of roaming solutions are meant for operators, without a framework to allow federated access to the steering platform to define and execute differential steering policy for multiple stakeholders.|
| YAML code available? | NO.|
| Validated in lab/productive environments? | NO. <br>A discussion is in progress with our select partners to incorporate steering of roaming solution along with API to their 5G SA/NSA backbone. |
| Validated with real customers? | YES. <br>This is a new level of control telco resellers and MVNOs are looking for from a long time. <br> |
| Validated with operators? | NO. |
|Supporters in API Backlog Working Group| NO. </em> |
