| API summary                               | The API enables App Developers to define intents in the form of policy thresholds for QoS metrics against the device and the application service. The API service will alert the consumers if and when the policy has breached. This API would be useful for applications that optimize user experience based on the user's network experience. |
| Technical viability                       | The type of network performance data required for this API can be categorized into 3 groups as listed below<br>1\.	Real time data<br>2\.	Near real time data <br>3\.	Historical data<br>Source of the data can be from 3GPP defined standard services as well as various network performance monitoring tools (active and passive) as deployed by the respective network operator.<br>QoS monitoring mechanisms can be referenced in 3GPP TS 23.501 v18.2.2 section 5.45. And in addition NWDAF can be leveraged when available.<br>Data from performance monitoring tools (Active and Passive) can be used for both 4G and 5G.<br>Based on one or more types of above listed data being available the API can be implemented to support current view of KPIs as well as predictive KPIs in the form of the API spec proposed.                                                                                  |
| Commercial viability                      | Requests for this functionality were shared by multiple ISVs.  Couple of ISVs were in the streaming and AR based gaming space.                                                                                                                    |
