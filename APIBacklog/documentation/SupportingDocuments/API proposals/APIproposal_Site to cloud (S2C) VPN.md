| API family name                           | Site to cloud (S2C) VPN                                      |
| API family owner                          | China Telecom,  Huawei                                       |
| API family summary                        | **High level description**<br>Instead of ordering a private or customized network service by phone call, or through customer manager manually, this API allows users to create and configure site to cloud network service according to the user request by one click. With the proposed API, when someone calls the API service with network SLA requirements, telecom operators can create non-public cloud leased network service by orchestrating the IP VPN connections of metropolitan network and/or backbone network. <br>S2C VPN API aims to provide multi-site, multi-cloud network connection for customers, and provide virtual private network services. Currently most of the use cases are in the field of industries, finance, education, medical, Internet of things, cloud desktop, cloud conference, cloud recording and etc.<br><br>**Input params**<br>service name,  access node type,  access node ip address, end node type,  end node ip address, network availability level, bandwidth, duration, routing protocol,  access node GIS address/ID.<br><br>**Output params**<br>API call success or failure response, service Id, resource Id<br><br> |
| Technical viability                       | This API uses existing IP VPN connection creation capabilities of MAN(Metropolitan Area Network) and backbone network in operators. |
| Commercial viability                      | This API is suitable to multi-sites, industries and applications which require private network service ( large bandwidth, low latency, high guarantee and security), fast and flexible on-demand service provisioning. The original customers can choose traditional product delivery mode or Service on Demand API mode. The new customers will use  Service on Demand API mode which is easy to use. |
